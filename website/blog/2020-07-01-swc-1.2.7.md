## Bugfixes

### crash of spack ([#872](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/872))

The swc manages the span in a fairly unusual way. It manages span information by creating a global map and assigning a range. In the case of swc, the global map should be protected with an atomic variable or ,utex because it supports threading.

To improve performance, area allocation is processed as one atomic operation and actual file data is stored using mutex, which was mixed with a bug that overlaps span of multiple files. This bug later caused a crash in the process of printing code, and there was a bug in which the process was abort because of the limitations of neon.

I changed the code so that the two don't mix. As a multi-threading issue, I can't say 100% because it's hard to reproduce, but I think it's solved.
