## Improvements

## Bugfixes

### static blocks: Improved output

Previously `swc` emitted

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static #_12 = (() => {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  })();
}
```

for

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  }
}
```

Now `swc` emits

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static #_2 = (() => {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  })();
}
```

Fixed by [@sosukesuzuki](https://github.com/sosukesuzuki) and by [#2652](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2652).

### typings: `es6` module ([#2633](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2633))

Previously there was a bug in type definitions which makes `tsc` angry about

```js
import * as swc from "@swc/core";
swc.transformSync("", {
  module: {
    type: "es6", // When this file is TypeScript, the typechecker complains about this line
  },
});
```

Fixed by [@magic-akari](https://github.com/magic-akari) and by [#2648](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2648)

### pass ordering ([#2413](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2413))

There was a bug in pass order. `destructuring` should be applied before `regenerator`, but it was not.
This caused compile-time exception complaining about complex binding in catch clauses.

Fixed by [#2629](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2629).

### minifier: pass limit ([#2604](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2604), [#2605](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2605))

Previously the limit of minifier was 30, but it was too low.
It's now increased to 100.

Fixed by [#2610](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2610).

### minifier: Fix for `@ericblade/quagga2`

There was a bug in logic for determine if we negate a boolean.

Fixed by [#2597](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2597).

### minifier: Fix for `murmur2`

There was a bug in logic for inlining variable assignments.
This bug broke `murmur2` and `@emotion/react` which depends on `murmur2`.

Fixed by [#2637](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2637).

### minifier: Fix for `react-countup`

Previously the analyzer didn't treat assignment with operator as 'usage' and the optimizer dropped the assignment because the 'usage' count is 0.

Fixed by [#2625](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2625).
